        To me a hero is someone that shwos integrity, honesty and leadership. Within in our society its so easy to manipulate the way you are viewed by the public.

        Honesty is so important to me because we are able to be pur true selves without having to fake beigng someone we're not. Integrity is very close to the definition of 
        honesty which is why i always think about the wto words together.

        Zendaya to me is one of the youngest heroes I can think of. She is one of the most honest artists I can think of talking abojut social injustices
        and much more. To me she is a leader by heart doing her own thing and not giving the public what they want. One of the things she does i look up to is her honesty when it comes to 
        photoshoots and just in general. Our society (specially little girls growing up) need to have good roll models that dont try to fake who they are physically and as a person.
